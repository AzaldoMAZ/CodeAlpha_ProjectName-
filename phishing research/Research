## üß† Social Engineering Tactics

Attackers use psychology to manipulate you into giving up information:

### 1. **Fear & Urgency**
- "Your account will be closed!"
- "Suspicious activity detected!"
- **Defense**: Take time to think. Real companies don't demand immediate action.

### 2. **Authority**
- Pretending to be your boss, IT department, or government agency
- **Defense**: Verify identity through official channels.

### 3. **Too Good to Be True**
- "You've won $1,000!"
- "Free iPhone - just click here!"
- **Defense**: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

### 4. **Curiosity**
- "You won't believe what your coworker said about you"
- "Check out this funny video"
- **Defense**: Don't click unknown links, even if they seem interesting.

### 5. **Help/Sympathy**
- "I'm stranded and need money"
- "Please help me access this account"
- **Defense**: Verify the person's identity before helping.

## üß† Quick Quiz - Test Your Knowledge

**Question 1**: You get an email from "amazon-security@gmail.com" saying your order was cancelled. What's suspicious?

**Answer**: Amazon doesn't use Gmail for official communications. Real Amazon emails come from @amazon.com domains.

**Question 2**: A website asks for your Social Security Number to "verify your identity" but the URL shows "http://" instead of "https://". Should you proceed?

**Answer**: No! Never enter sensitive information on non-HTTPS sites. The missing "s" means it's not secure.

**Question 3**: Your boss emails asking you to buy gift cards for a client meeting. The email looks normal. What should you do?

**Answer**: Verify by calling or texting your boss directly. This is a common scam even when emails look legitimate.
